- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jezzy-j420
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, developing programs and mostly cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning honestly...everything... I know absolutely nothing. I got into this to figure out who hacked my phone but found out that it's interesting to learn 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I don't think I'd be any help to anyone trying to collaborate but I'm open minded
- 📫 How to reach me ... jezzy_j420@outlook.com
